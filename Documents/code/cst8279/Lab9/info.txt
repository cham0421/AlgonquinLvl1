It is recommended that you read the entire lab before you start working.

What you will do:

Use Python to read and write the content of files
Practice the use of Python dictionaries

Task 1:
Download File Package Week9Files
The two text files 2000_BoysNames.txt and 2000_GirlsNames.txt list the popularity of boys names and girls names in 2000. 
The format of the file is simple, one line per entry with the name followed by a space followed by the number of children carrying that name. 
You must write a python program that reads each text file then converts it into a csv format: "name",count then saves the entry in a csv file. 
The output csv file must include the following header as its first line: "First Name","Count"

Task 2:
Write a python program that prompts the user for the name of .csv file then reads and displays each line of the file as a Python list.
 Test your program on the 2 csv files that you generated in Task 1.

Task 3:
Write a function generateDictionary that reads the file font3.txt and 
generate a dictionary where the key is the character ane the vaue is the 8*8 bit list representation of the character.
