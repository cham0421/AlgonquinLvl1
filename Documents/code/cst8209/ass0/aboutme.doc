Hello, 

My name is Waseem Chamaa and I'm 27 years old. I graduated from Carleton university with a degree in Computer Science in 2016.

I got into programming through my love of video games and interest in graphic design. I always loved playing games as a kid and wanted to become a game developer. When I got to high school my school was offering a computer programming class and I took it in the hopes that it would teach me something that could help me get closer to my dream. After graduating from high school and having to pick a program for university I chose not to pursue a game development stream due to the lack of gaming companies in Ottawa at the time. Due to some life choices and wanted to start my life post education I decided to change from an honors program to the major degree for Computer Science. Those life choices turned out not to work out. After a few months of being essentially useless I started to look for work in Ottawa but wasn't able to find new grad/intern positions. My friend who moved to Toronto then told me about a position at his company so I applied and got the position.

For the next 2 years I would live in Toronto working for a company called nanopay. The first few months were amazing, I was learning so much and being teach really useful things. We were working in Angular 2 and in the process of moving to Angular 4. This was my first real JavaScript and HTML exposure. This all changed with the hiring of a new Vice President of Technology and CTO.  The CTO introduced a new framework and had all of use move to it. It was called FOAM2 and it is a model based framework in its infancy with high ambitions. I don't have many nice words to say about the framework or the creator. The developers there and I have the understanding that the framework would be amazing and change the way developers program but only if someone could take the controls away from the CTO or at least loosen his grips. The framework encompasses almost all parts of the stack. While it was written with base of JavaScript it was very vanilla, the back end was Java that is modeled and then converted from JavaScript. As far as DB it is a journal system. In February of this year I was let go without cause, not being to cover the cost of rent in Toronto anymore and missing my family and the city I grew up in , I decided to move back to Ottawa. For the next few months I spent searching for work with the knowledge that i knew as well as trying to learn for myself. I found it very hard to focus on a specific framework as I didn't want to invest in a language that only a select few companies would require. I decided that my best bet would be to apply to college and while waiting for school to start keep applying to jobs and trying to learn from myself and worst case go to college to at least stop the payments to OSAP and possibly get coop from the program.
