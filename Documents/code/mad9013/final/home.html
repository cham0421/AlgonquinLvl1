        This technology is a library of CSS that allows for easier CSS designs.
        They use a grid-based system that makes each row contain 12 columns.
        They also have styles for all types of inputs and stylings. It is a great tool to make websites with.
        They can be very annoying when you try to change a single aspect like the color

        HTML is the base for websites. Together with CSS it allows very nice webpages.
        We have used it to design websites like this one.
        It also allows for embedding script languages which can affect it.

      <p>
        JavaScript is a scripting language that when paired with html allows for data to be stored and
        allows for changes to the HTML dynamically.
        There are many frameworks that are build from JavaScript. Currently I would say that a web developers best bet
        is to learn these frameworks as every company I have looked at for work requires at least one of these frameworks

      <p>
        SQL is a means of storing information within a database.
        That data can then be retrieved and manipulated.
        This is how most data in the world is stored.
        With SQL queries we can do a multitute of things including but not limited to creating databases/tables/columns or rows 
        as well as manipulate them by adding, editing and deleting entries.

        A scripting language like JavaScript. This is a very versatile language.
        This language is what we used as the base of the programming course we are currently learning.
        The language has quickly become one of the most used languages for programming because of its versatility

      <p>
        Sass is a preprocessing language that extends the functionality of CSS. For instance it allows the addition of variables into CSS to increase reusability.
        It also allows for nested rules allowing less code to be rewritten. Once you complete writting in sass you can then run it which converts it into a .css file.
